# [TASK] Mitigate Content Repetition in Cascade Mode

## 1. Analysis & Task Breakdown (Planner)

The root cause of content repetition in `create_course_cascade` is that the full text of each generated chapter is appended to the context for the next one. This leads the LLM to re-process and often repeat information from prior chapters.

The refined solution, based on user feedback, is to provide the LLM with the summaries of all previously generated chapters and explicitly instruct it not to repeat those topics. This provides a concise history of covered content without bloating the context.

**Note on Impact:** These changes are internal to the course generation logic. The public signatures of the functions called by the GUI and CLI will not change. Therefore, no updates to the GUI or CLI code are required, ensuring the changes are not overly drastic.

### Task List
- [ ] **Task 1: Refactor `create_chapter_prompt_template` to handle previous summaries.** I will add a new, optional section to the prompt. When a summary of previous chapters is provided, this section will instruct the LLM to build upon, and not repeat, the topics already covered.
- [ ] **Task 2: Update `generate_chapter` to accept previous chapter summaries.** I will modify the function's signature to accept a new optional argument, `previous_chapters_summary: Optional[str] = None`, which will be passed to the prompt template.
- [ ] **Task 3: Modify `create_course_cascade` to use summarized context.** I will change the context-building logic. Instead of appending the full text of each new chapter, the function will now compile a summary of all previously completed chapters and pass this to the `generate_chapter` function. The ever-growing context will be removed.
- [ ] **Task 4: Add/update usage examples in the docs folder and ensure `make docs-test` passes.**

## 2. Executor Log & Status

- **DONE**: Task 1 - Refactored `create_chapter_prompt_template` function to accept optional `previous_chapters_summary` parameter and include anti-repetition instructions in the prompt
- **DONE**: Task 2 - Updated `generate_chapter` function signature and implementation to accept and pass the new `previous_chapters_summary` parameter
- **DONE**: Task 3 - Modified `create_course_cascade` function to use summarized context instead of full text accumulation
- **DONE**: Task 4 - Added comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality using proper mocks
- **DONE**: Task 5 - Updated documentation in `docs/usage.md` to accurately describe the new cascade mode behavior and ran `make docs-test` successfully
- **DONE**: Task 6 - Fixed failing test and ran `make test` - all 77 tests now pass, 2 skipped

**IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:**
- Cascade mode now builds a concise summary of all previous chapters and passes it as context to prevent repetition
- Each chapter generation receives explicit instructions to avoid repeating topics already covered
- The original content is always used as the base, with previous summaries serving as a "what to avoid" guide
- No changes required to GUI or CLI interfaces as promised - all changes are internal to the generation logic
