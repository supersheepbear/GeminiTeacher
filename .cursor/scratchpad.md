# [TASK] Fix missing summary generation in cascade mode

## 1. Analysis & Task Breakdown (Planner)

The root cause of the missing summary is a parsing failure in the `parse_chapter_content` function. The function expects specific Chinese headers (e.g., `# 标题与摘要`) to identify and extract the summary section from the LLM's raw output. However, the LLM is sometimes inconsistent and may return English headers (e.g., `## Summary`) or slightly different variations, causing the parser to miss the summary section entirely.

The solution is to make the parser more robust by allowing it to recognize multiple header variations for each section (summary, explanation, and extension), including both English and Chinese forms.

### Task List

- [x] **Task 1: Refactor `parse_chapter_content` to handle multiple header variations.** I will update the `sections` dictionary within the `parse_chapter_content` function in `src/geminiteacher/coursemaker.py` to include a list of possible English and Chinese headers for each section. This will make the parsing logic more flexible and resilient to LLM inconsistencies.
- [x] **Task 2: Create a unit test to verify the fix.** I will add a new test case to `tests/test_coursemaker.py` that specifically simulates the problematic LLM output (using English headers). This test will assert that the refactored `parse_chapter_content` function correctly extracts all sections, proving the fix is effective.
- [x] **Task 3: Add/update usage examples in the docs folder and ensure `make docs-test` passes.** I will review the documentation and run the necessary checks to ensure everything is up-to-date and passing.

## 2. Executor Log & Status

- **DONE**: Task 1 - Refactored `parse_chapter_content` to accept multiple header formats.
- **DONE**: Task 2 - Added a new unit test `test_parse_chapter_content_with_english_headers` and confirmed all 36 tests pass.

## 4. Lessons & Discoveries

- Discovered that the LLM can be inconsistent with output formatting, requiring more flexible parsing logic on the application side. 

# [TASK] Prevent LLM from generating introductory reviews of past chapters

## 1. Analysis & Task Breakdown (Planner)

The user has observed that the LLM often begins each chapter with a lengthy review of concepts from previous chapters, which they consider a "waste of words." The root cause is that the current prompt for chapter generation does not explicitly instruct the LLM to avoid this behavior. As an educator-persona, the LLM defaults to this review-first teaching style.

The solution is to add a direct, negative constraint to the chapter generation prompt, instructing the LLM to skip the review and begin directly with the new material.

### Task List

- [ ] **Task 1: Modify `create_chapter_prompt_template` to add an anti-review instruction.** I will update the prompt template in `src/geminiteacher/coursemaker.py`. The new instruction will explicitly tell the LLM *not* to start the chapter with a summary of previous topics and to get straight to the point.
- [ ] **Task 2: Update unit tests for `create_chapter_prompt_template`.** I will add an assertion to an existing test in `tests/test_coursemaker.py` to confirm that the new instruction is present in the generated prompt.
- [ ] **Task 3: Add/update usage examples in the docs folder and ensure `make docs-test` passes.** I will review the documentation and run the necessary checks as the final step.

## 2. Executor Log & Status

- **DONE**: Task 1 - Modified `create_chapter_prompt_template` to add an anti-review instruction.
- **DONE**: Task 2 - Updated unit test to verify the new instruction is present in the prompt. `make test` passed with 79 tests passing.
- **DONE**: Task 3 - Ran `make docs-test` successfully. All tasks are complete.

## 3. Reviewer's Audit & Feedback (Reviewer Only)
- **Functional Correctness**: [PASS] - The change directly addresses the user's request by adding a negative constraint to the prompt to prevent introductory reviews.
- **Test Protocol Adherence**: [PASS] - The relevant unit test was correctly updated to assert the presence of the new instruction, and the full test suite (`make test`) passes.
- **Documentation Adherence**: [PASS] - The documentation check (`make docs-test`) passes. No user-facing changes were needed.
- **Python Protocol Adherence**: [PASS] - The change is minor and adheres to all project standards.
- **Workflow Hygiene**: [PASS] - The scratchpad was updated correctly at each stage of the Planner/Executor workflow.
- **Summary**: The execution was successful. The implemented change is correct, tested, and follows all project protocols. The task is now complete.

## 4. Lessons & Discoveries

- Direct, negative constraints (e.g., "Do not do X") can be effective in guiding LLM behavior for specific stylistic requirements. 

# [TASK] Add more detailed logging to show LLM wait times

## 1. Analysis & Task Breakdown (Planner)

The user is experiencing a lack of feedback when the application appears to be stuck. They cannot tell if the program is waiting for a response from the LLM or performing another long-running task. The current logging shows when a chapter starts and when it's saved, but not the steps in between.

The solution is to add logging statements immediately before and after every call to the LLM. The existing code uses a `verbose` flag to control console output via `print()` statements, so the new logging should follow this pattern for consistency. This will provide the user with clear "start" and "end" markers for each network-bound LLM request.

### Task List

- [ ] **Task 1: Add verbose logging to `generate_toc`**. I will update the function signature to accept a `verbose` flag and add `print` statements before and after the `chain.invoke()` call.
- [ ] **Task 2: Add verbose logging to `generate_chapter`**. I will update the function signature to accept a `verbose` flag and add `print` statements around its `chain.invoke()` call.
- [ ] **Task 3: Add verbose logging to `generate_summary`**. I will update its signature to accept a `verbose` flag and add `print` statements around its `chain.invoke()` call.
- [ ] **Task 4: Propagate the `verbose` flag**. I will update the main course creation functions (`create_course`, `create_course_parallel`, and `create_course_cascade`) to pass their `verbose` flag down to the `generate_*` functions.
- [ ] **Task 5: Update all relevant unit tests**. The signatures of the mocked functions will change, so I will update the test files (`tests/test_coursemaker.py`) to match the new signatures and prevent tests from breaking.
- [ ] **Task 6: Add/update usage examples in the docs folder and ensure `make docs-test` passes.**

## 2. Executor Log & Status

- **DONE**: Task 1 - Added verbose logging to `generate_toc`, `generate_chapter`, and `generate_summary` functions.
- **DONE**: Task 2 - Added verbose logging around all `chain.invoke()` calls with clear "→ Sending..." and "← Received..." messages.
- **DONE**: Task 3 - Added verbose logging to `generate_summary` function.
- **DONE**: Task 4 - Updated all course creation functions to propagate the `verbose` flag down to the generation functions.
- **DONE**: Task 5 - Fixed function signatures and updated test assertions in `tests/test_coursemaker.py` and `tests/test_teacher.py`. All 79 tests pass successfully.
- **DONE**: Task 6 - Ran `make docs-test` successfully. Documentation builds without issues.

## 3. Reviewer's Audit & Feedback (Reviewer Only)
- **Functional Correctness**: [PASS] - The implemented logging solution directly addresses the user's request for visibility into LLM wait times. Clear "→ Sending..." and "← Received..." messages provide exactly the feedback needed.
- **Test Protocol Adherence**: [PASS] - All tests follow TDD principles with proper mocking. Full test suite passes with 79 tests passing, 2 skipped. All function signature changes were properly tested.
- **Documentation Adherence**: [PASS] - Documentation was reviewed and `make docs-test` passes successfully. No user-facing changes required documentation updates.
- **Python Protocol Adherence**: [PASS] - All changes follow project standards. New function parameters include proper type hints (`verbose: bool = False`) and NumPy-style docstring updates.
- **Workflow Hygiene**: [PASS] - The scratchpad was maintained throughout all stages. Clear task breakdown, execution tracking, and completion marking.
- **Summary**: The implementation successfully solves the user's problem. The logging provides clear visibility into when the system is waiting for LLM responses versus performing other operations. All project protocols were followed correctly.

## 4. Lessons & Discoveries

- Adding verbose logging to LLM functions requires careful propagation through the call chain to ensure the flag reaches all relevant functions.
- When modifying function signatures, systematic test assertion updates are crucial but can be time-consuming with many test files.
