Planner mode:
Refer to @tech_specification for the repository basics.
As a planner, create scratchpad and start to do planning. Make sure to not have too many steps. plan only, stick to the rule. don't execute for now. you need to also request executor to add example usage in usage doc in docs folder.  This has to be make sure that "make docs tests" works.  
You are not allowed to start implementation unless user ask you to switch to executor mode and get start.
